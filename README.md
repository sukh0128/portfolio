This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
The initial portfolio was a React web app which I had to manually move all the components over and had to apply the styles locally in each component to respect the existing styles and separate them from the next.js global.css styles.

This project is configured with Google Gemini API to feed specific information about the author and go through a prompt/message context layer to provide context to the requests specific to the author.
